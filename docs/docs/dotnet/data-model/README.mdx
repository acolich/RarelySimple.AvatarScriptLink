# Data Model

Netsmart has defined the data model to use with Avatar ScriptLink to support consitent integration with any SOAP API that can support the data model and security requirements.
This includes some coded values (I.e., `ErrorCode` and `RowAction`) that the AvatarScriptLink.NET library defines classes for.
Additionally, the AvatarScriptLink.NET library expands on the data model to assist with common implementation designs.

## Avatar ScriptLink

The request and response payloads consist of an OptionObject2015 as defined in your APIs WSDL.

### Multiple Iteration

### OptionObject2015

The OptionObject2015 holds all of the content of and metadata describing the calling myAvatar form.

### FormObject

The FormObject represents a section of a myAvatar Form.

[Learn more](./formobject)

### RowObject

The RowObject represents the contents of a myAvatar form section. I.e., the collection of FieldObjects that make up the section.

[Learn more](./rowobject)

### FieldObject

The FieldObject represents a field on a myAvatar form.

## AvatarScriptLink.NET

The following have been implemented as part of the AvatarScriptLink.NET library to assist with writing and troubleshooting ScriptLink APIs.

### ErrorCode

Avatar ScriptLink APIs must respond with an ErrorCode (i.e., Status Code).
The valid codes are defined by myAvatar and are listed below with their helper class equivalents.

### FieldAction

*This is a utility class leveraged by the library internally and is not required in the most common use cases.*

The FieldAction class is used within the AvatarScriptLink.NET to indicate which action is to be performed on a FieldObject.

| Action   | Description                                         |
|:---------|:----------------------------------------------------|
| Disable  | Instructs method to disable a FieldObject.          |
| Enable   | Instructs method to enable a FieldObject.           |
| Lock     | Instructs method to lock a FieldObject.             |
| Modify   | Instructs method to mark a FieldObject as modified. |
| Optional | Instructs method to mark a FieldObject as optional. |
| Require  | Instructs method to mark a FieldObject as required. |
| Unlock   | Instructs method to unlock a FieldObject.           |

### Parameter

Avatar ScriptLink allows parameters to be defined when configuring myAvatar to call your ScriptLink API.
Typically, implementers will delimit this parameter to allow the passing of multiple values to the API to modify the behavior.
The Parameter class helps to parse the delimited parameter string.

<ParameterExample />

### RowAction

The RowAction class is used to help you return valid RowAction values to myAvatar.
These values instruct myAvatar to add, edit, or delete a RowObject upon receipt of the response from the ScriptLink API.
